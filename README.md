# Supplementary material for Kernels of MM Hamming
Supplementary material for the paper "Kernels of Mallows Models under the Hamming Distance for solving the Quadratic Assignment Problem"


### Additional figures

The AdditionalFigures.pdf file contains the additional results of the experiment on the fitness transition.

### Reproducing the results

Just run "bash all_instances_on_parallel.sh" in the terminal. This will compile the source and run the binary on parallel for all instances.

### Execution time

The execution time of all the compared algorithms is provided in the "time_algorithms.csv" file.

### Statistical analysis

The file "comparison_between_BPA_and_NHST.pdf" explains why we use BPA instead of NHST in our paper.


### The paper

The open version of the article is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08800
